    \runsubsection{Markforged}

        \item Worked on taking developing new features and technologies into the Markforged Tech Stack

        \item Validation Team
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Manipulated a \textbf{graph} data structure that was used to
                  represent 3D locations as well as contextual data
                  (proprietary take on Spatial Digital Twins)
                  using \textbf{mobile} and \textbf{web} front ends
            \item Implemented on demand rendering system for the point cloud viewer used by PTC's products
        \end{itemize}
        \item Vuforia Model Target Generator (MTG) and Area Target Generator (ATG)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Drove technical debt efforts and architectural reworks of the entire MTG and ATG codebases.
                  I also configured linters, formatters, and other build tools to
                  passively improve developers' skills
            \item Developed 3D (\textbf{ThreeJS}) gizmos and logic to use for the
                  Vuforia SDK 10.10 User Volume feature.
                  This led to me spearheading the effort to integrate with bare bones
                  existing libraries to have a set of
                  \textbf{reusable} web and 3D component libraries
                  that multiple teams across the company could use
        \end{itemize}

        \sectionsep
        \item Ideated on and developed experiences with emerging technology ranging from short-term prototypes for internal stakeholders to
        researching longer-term initiatives. Usually this meant organizing my own work and executing on it without much external supervision.
        \item Focused mostly on Augmented Reality, 3D, or similar experiences.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item published \textbf{\href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3334480.3383180}{Doll House Projection Mapping project}} at CHI EA ’20
            \item View In Room 3D for iOS and Android

        \item Created a pipeline to gather crowdsourced
        image correspondence data from users distributed throughout the world
        to create a dataset of high quality optical flow annotations.
        \item Created a
        \textbf{\href{https://github.com/johanos/pollefeys-self-calibration-and-metric-reconstruction}{software pipeline}}
        to reproduce a
        \textbf{\href{https://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/pubs/PollefeysIJCV99.pdf}{research paper}}
        on calculating camera intrinsic parameters using image correspondences and projective geometry
