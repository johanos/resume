# Resumes

This repo holds my resumes as I make them/change them

Use the LaTeX workshop extension to edit them (see `@recommended` extensions)

I think either doing TexLive or TinyTex is fine for the LaTeX distribution but TinyText will require
some additional dependency installations for certain packages.
